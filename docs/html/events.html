            <h4>La Feria — Details</h4>
            <p>Information about La Feria (location, casetas, and tips for getting around.) 
            Feria de Abril: a springtime celebration held in the grounds known as the Real de la Feria. The area is laid out in casetas, both private and public, where traditional social and gastronomic activities are preserved; flamenco singing and dancing, typical attire (traje de flamenca and traje corto), and offerings of tapas and drinks such as the rebujito are common. During the day family activities and rides in horse-drawn carriages predominate; at night the fairground takes on a different character with the lighting switched on, creating a bright, festive atmosphere. The fair maintains strong local cultural roots and its own codes of conduct that define its character.

        <div id="semana-info" class="detail">
            <h4>Semana Santa — Details</h4>
            <p>Semana Santa in Seville is a deeply traditional and moving experience: brotherhoods (cofradías) carry elaborate floats through the streets accompanied by marching bands and penitents. Procession schedules and routes change every year; check official timetables and route maps to plan your visit and avoid large crowds. During these days mobility measures are often in place (road closures, bus diversions and temporary pedestrian zones). Wear comfortable shoes, respect the processional routes and use official viewing points to enjoy the processions without obstructing them.</p>

        <div id="flamenco-info" class="detail">
            <h4>Bienal del Flamenco — Details</h4>
            <p>The Bienal and Seville's flamenco scene bring together top singers, dancers and guitarists in theaters, peñas and tablaos. Programming ranges from traditional performances to contemporary and experimental productions; there are also masterclasses, meetings and exhibitions that explore different styles (palos) such as soleá, bulería and seguiriya. Buy tickets in advance for high-demand shows and check each venue's schedule: many performances take place at night, and the nearby dining scene complements the experience.</p>

         <div id="deporte-info" class="detail">
            <h4>Sport events — Details</h4>
            <p>Seville hosts significant sporting events: top-division football matches (Sevilla FC and Real Betis), popular races such as the Half Marathon, and cycling and triathlon competitions. For matches, check official club calendars and mobility guidance around stadiums (Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán and Benito Villamarín), where access zones and numbered entrances are usually enforced. For races and outdoor routes, review route maps, aid stations and safety recommendations. Buy official tickets and plan public transport in advance on high-attendance days.</p>
